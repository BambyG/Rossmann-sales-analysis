This analysis is based on a Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales) about Rossmann's sales.
Rossmann is a German drugstore chain which has more than 3000 shops in 7 countries. This dataset is only based on the German based shops, 1115 in total.

This project will be divided into 2 main parts:
- Understanding the current situation, by cleaning the data and exploring it (EDA).
- Forecasting the sales that are depending on factors such as promotions, competition, school holidays, state holidays, seasonality, and locality.

For the first step, I am using Python programming language and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly for data cleaning, analysis and visualization.

The second step is done using scikit a Python library for Machine learning.
Please open the **final_presentation_rossmann.ipynb** to see the project.
